2. Project Overview:
   
 * Purpose: The primary purpose of CitizenAI is to provide an intelligent platform for enhanced citizen engagement and efficient public service delivery. It aims to streamline communication between citizens and government/service providers, offer personalized services, and provide data-driven insights for improved governance.
   
 * Goals of CitizenAI Platform:
   
   * Seamless Citizen Interaction: Enable citizens to easily interact with the platform through multiple channels like web portals, mobile apps, chatbots, and SMS/messaging.
     
   * Efficient Query Processing: Utilize AI to understand citizen queries, classify issues, and provide accurate and timely responses.
     
   * Personalized Citizen Services: Maintain citizen profiles and leverage knowledge bases to offer tailored information and services.
     
   * Real-time Sentiment Analysis: Monitor social media and other channels to gauge public sentiment and identify emerging issues.
     
   * Data-Driven Insights: Provide comprehensive analytics and reporting to help authorities understand citizen needs, track performance, and make informed decisions.
     
   * Scalability and Robustness: Design a system capable of handling a large volume of citizen interactions and data.

* Features:
  
   * Multi-Channel Access: Supports interaction via Web Portal, Mobile App, Chatbot Interface, and SMS/Messaging.
     
   * Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Direct integration with AI models like IBM Granite for processing citizen queries and understanding intent.
     
   * Sentiment Analysis & Issue Classification: Capable of analyzing text for sentiment and categorizing issues from various sources, including social media.
     
   * Knowledge Base Integration: Utilizes a comprehensive knowledge base to provide accurate and relevant information to citizens.
     
   * Citizen Profiles: Maintains profiles to offer personalized services and track individual interactions.
     
   * Analytics & Reporting Dashboard: Provides a Flask-based dashboard for monitoring key metrics, trends, and performance.
     
 * Core Functionalities:
   
   * Citizen Query Reception: Captures queries and feedback from various digital channels.
     
   * AI-Powered Processing: Processes queries using NLU and classifies issues for routing and response generation.
     
   * Sentiment Monitoring: Continuously analyzes citizen feedback and social media for sentiment and emerging trends.
     
   * Information Retrieval & Generation: Retrieves information from the knowledge base or generates responses based on query analysis.
     
   * Citizen Profile Management: Manages and updates citizen profiles based on interactions.

4. Setup Instructions:
   
 * Prerequisites:
   
   * Hardware:
     
     * Server (Cloud-based or On-premise)
       
     * Sufficient RAM and CPU for AI model processing
       
     * Storage for databases
       
   * Software:
     
     * Python 3.8+
       
     * Flask
       
     * TensorFlow / PyTorch (or relevant AI frameworks for IBM Granite integration if not directly consumed as a service)
     
     * NLTK / SpaCy (for additional text processing if needed)
       
     * Database System (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
       
     * Redis (for caching/session management, optional)
       
     * Web Server (e.g., Nginx, Apache)

5. Running the Application:
   
 * Dependencies: All Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt must be installed.
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 * Database Setup: Ensure your database is configured and initialized as per setup_db.py or your database scripts.
   
 * Configuration: Update config/config.yaml with your database credentials, API keys for IBM Granite (if applicable), and other environment-specific settings.
   
 6. API Documentation:
    
This RESTful API enables:

 * Receiving citizen queries via various channels.
   
 * Sending queries for AI processing (NLU, sentiment analysis, issue classification).
   
 * Retrieving responses from the knowledge base or generated by the AI.
   
 * Managing citizen profiles.
   
 * Accessing analytics and reports.
   
Example API Endpoints (conceptual):

 * POST /api/v1/query: Submit a new citizen query.
   
 * GET /api/v1/citizen/{id}: Retrieve a citizen's profile.
   
 * PUT /api/v1/citizen/{id}: Update a citizen's profile.
   
 * GET /api/v1/analytics/sentiment: Get overall sentiment trends.
   
 * GET /api/v1/analytics/issues: Get categorized issue trends.

7. Testing:
